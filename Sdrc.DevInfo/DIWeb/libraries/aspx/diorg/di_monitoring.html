                          <p class="diorg_p"><strong>Q: How does di  Monitoring improve on traditional methods for tracking frameworks?</strong></p>
                          <p>&nbsp;</p>
                          <p class="diorg_p">
                            A: The di Monitoring system is built on established methodologies for creating logical frameworks that tie performance data to  stated goals. Traditionally, these frameworks have been static documents, available only in hard-copy format. As such, users are unable to view progress on all or selected framework elements in a single location, nor can multiple partners simultaneously create and edit a framework as a team.</p>
                          <p>&nbsp;</p>
                          <p class="diorg_p">
                            In contrast, di Monitoring converts these traditionally static reference documents into dynamic tools for  development. For example, with a click, users can view only those performance indicators that are off track, or only those that are relevant to their area of interest or expertise. Actual versus planned values and progress towards development targets can be quickly displayed in graphical form. Data can be easily exported into customized reports.</p>
                          <p>&nbsp;</p>
                          <p class="diorg_p">
                            di Monitoring streamlines the work of creating and updating monitoring frameworks. The application is designed to harness the strengths of a team of specialists, both in terms of framework design and administration. Framework elements such as pillars can be conveniently divided among a team working remotely, then joined together into a single framework once the individual components are completed. By enabling teams to conveniently share responsibilities for framework creation and data entry, the system expands the potential for creative development alliances.</p>
                          <p>&nbsp;</p>
                          <p class="diorg_p">
                            Administrators are given freedom to coordinate web-based and localized data entry. In addition, economic or social data for projects at the  local level can be automatically aggregated to generate macro-level values.<strong></strong></p>
                          <p>&nbsp;</p>
                          <p class="diorg_p" ><strong>Q: Can di Monitoring be used for financial tracking?</strong></p>
                          <p>&nbsp;</p>
                          <p class="diorg_p">
                            A: Yes. di Monitoring can be used to track financial data as well as project or activity-specific data. Users can incorporate key aid effectiveness information, in line with international agreements and standards such as IATI. Financial flows, results information, timelines, project descriptions, geographic information and other aid data can be built into di Monitoring frameworks.</p>
