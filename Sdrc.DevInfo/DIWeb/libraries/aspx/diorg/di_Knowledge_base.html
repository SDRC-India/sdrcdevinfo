									<p class="diorg_p"><strong> How can I know  which database contains the data I'm looking for?</strong></p><br />
									 <p class="diorg_p">The Catalog allows you to filter by country and/or type the  name of the indicator and/or area you are looking for (at the top), and will  automatically display the databases containing that information, with an  opportunity to preview the data.</p>

									<p class="diorg_header"><strong><a id="2" name="2"></a>Data Query Service/API</strong>:</p>
									
									<p class="diorg_p"><strong>What does the  DevInfo Data Query API do?</strong></p><br />
									  <p class="diorg_p">The DevInfo Data Query API allows third-party applications  to communicate directly with DevInfo 7 devoid of any user knowledge or  intervention. As an end user, you may only see a single interface, whereas in  reality there are multiple applications working behind the scenes together with  the help of APIs. The DevInfo Data Query API can also prove useful if you have  a very large number of data queries to make. Instead of manually querying the  data, which would be a slow and error-prone process, you can use the API to  conduct an &ldquo;electronic handshake&rdquo; between your website and DevInfo 7, thereby  avoiding accidentally mistaken selections and saving a considerable amount of  time.</p>

                                    <p class="dior_p"><strong>Why can't others  access my visualizations in the Gallery? Why are some visuals already there?</strong><br />
                                      Once you've created an account, you can save your  visualizations to a private gallery that only you will be able to access. A  series of pre-created visualizations are made available by the database  administrator.
  </p><br />
                                    <p class="diorg_p"><strong> I saved  visualizations in the Gallery but cannot access them anymore. How come?</strong><br />
                                      You might not be logged in, or you might have not selected  the database from which you saved the original visualization.
  </p><br />
                                    <p class="diorg_p"><strong>Once I've saved an  output to my Gallery, can I make any changes to it at a later time?</strong><br />
No, while it is  possible to download a visualization from the Gallery, it is not possible to make  direct edits to it in DevInfo.</p><br />

									<p class="diorg_p"><strong>Will I be able to  use my existing DevInfo 6.0 database with DevInfo 7.0?</strong><br />
									  Yes, Please consult the DevInfo 7.0 Deployment Guide, which  guides you through a step-by-step process in how to upload your database to a  DevInfo 7.0 web application.
  </p><br />
									<p class="diorg_p"><strong> Do I have to be  trained on DevInfo 7.0?</strong><br />
									  DevInfo 7.0 builds on the technology of DevInfo 6.0 and  contains an even more intuitive and user-friendly interface. Additional  resources, including full documentation, are available on www.devinfo.org. For  information on training opportunities, please contact the DevInfo Global  Administrator at UNICEF.
  </p><br />
									<p class="diorg_p"><strong>Would I be able to  obtain a desktop version of DevInfo 7.0?</strong><br />
									  DevInfo 7.0 is being initially released as a standalone web  application. A desktop version is under development. Please visit our website  at www.devinfo.org for further updates.
  </p><br />
									<p class="diorg_p"><strong> How much does it  cost to upgrade from DevInfo 5.0/6.0 to DevInfo 7.0?</strong><br />
									  There is no charge for the upgrade. DevInfo continues to be  provided royalty-free by the United Nations.
  </p><br />
									<p class="diorg_p"><strong>How has searching  and speed been enhanced in the online version?</strong><br />
									  DevInfo 7 offers many performance optimization techniques to  increase the speed of data searches and data views. For example, the Quick Data  Search feature allows searching by keywords, topic and area in a single screen.  Keyword searching has also been enhanced to allow entry of multiple keywords.
  </p><br />
									<p class="diorg_p"><strong>How will DevInfo  7.0 work with a Mac?</strong><br />
									  Since DevInfo 7.0 is  a web application, it will work on all browsers, both PCs and Macs.
  </p><br />
									<p class="diorg_p"><strong>What are the new  visualization tools in DevInfo 7.0?</strong><br />
									  In addition to the tables, graphs and maps available in  DevInfo 6, DevInfo 7 offers new visualizations such as scatter plots, pyramid  charts, radar charts and tree maps, as well as enhancements on previous  visualizations (line charts, bar charts, pie charts, column charts, stacked bar  charts, and 2D maps).</p><br />

                                      The 'My Data' feature of DevInfo 7.0 allows you to upload  data in table format and create maps and graphs without creating a database  through the Database Administration application. Through a simple upload or  copy and paste, visualizations can be created, saved and shared.x
  </p><br />
                                    <p class="diorg_p"><strong>Can I store the  work done through My Data?</strong><br />
                                      You can save the outputs created using the My Data feature  (either by downloading them or saving them to your gallery), but you will not  be able to store the actual data entered.</p><br />

                                      Visitors to any DevInfo 7 adaptation may wish to use the  built-in DevInfo 7 SDMX Registry to do the following: (a) Subscribe to receive  e-mail notifications of new data and metadata registrations for the database, (b)  Query the SDMX-ML data/metadata files of the database, (c) Map database  indicators to the MDG data structure, or (d) Access various web services  functions for incorporation by developers into their own external applications.</p>

									<p class="diorg_header"><strong><a id="7" name="7"></a>Searching for Data:</strong></p>
                                    <p class="pfaq">&nbsp;</p>
									
									<p class="diorg_p"><strong>I've been using the  Quick Data Search but can't find the information I'm looking for. It keeps on  saying &quot;No records found.&quot;</strong><br />
									  The information you are looking for might not be in the  database. Change your search criteria by looking for another indicator and/or  area, or click on Catalog and select another database that might have such  information. You can also try using the Advanced Search &ldquo;Show where data exist  feature&rdquo; to search for specific indicator subgroups or areas.<strong></strong>
  </p><br />
									<p class="diorg_p"><strong>How come I can  find certain indicators in the &quot;Browse&rdquo;tools that don't show up in the  Quick Data Search?</strong><br />
									  Not all indicators are stored within the Quick Data Search.  The database administrator chooses which information is accessible via QDS -  the rest can be found via Advanced Search or Browse tools.
  </p><br />
									<p class="diorg_p"><strong>What is the  difference between Advanced Search and Browse for data by Topic/Area?</strong><br />
									  The Advanced Search allows you to browse your data by  selecting both one or more indicators, as well as one or more geographic areas.  The Browse for data by Topic or Area allows you to do each of these as an  individual step.
  </p><br />
									<p class="diorg_p"><strong>What does the Add  to Cart button do?</strong><br />
									  If you wish to select more than one indicator and/or area,  simply click on Add to Cart to save your selection. For example, should you  wish to compare an indicator for multiple areas, adding the various areas to  the cart will allow you to visualize all results simultaneously.
  </p><br />
									<p class="diorg_p"><strong> Why are there two &ldquo;Add to Cart&rdquo; button in the search  results?</strong><br />
									  If your search results contain data available at a lower  geographic level, you may see two &ldquo;Add to cart&rdquo; links. For example, if you use  the Quick Data Search to search for data on infant mortality rate in Southern  Asia, the application will display data for the Southern Asia region as a whole  on top, and data for the individual Southern Asia countries below. The upper  &ldquo;Add to cart&rdquo; link adds the data values for the Southern Asia region (as a  whole) to the Data Cart, while the lower &ldquo;Add to cart&rdquo; link adds the data  values for the individual Southern Asian countries to the Data Cart.
  </p><br />
									<p class="diorg_p"><strong> I did a search  query and I've been seeing the spinning &quot;Searching database&quot; message  for over five seconds.</strong><br />
									  If your data takes more than a few seconds to appear, it  might be because there are many results loading. For instance, choosing an indicator  without an area (or vice versa) can lead the system to search through tens of  thousands of records.</p>

                                    <p class="diorg_p"><strong>Why are some of  the visualizations disabled?</strong><br />
                                      Some visualizations, such as the Pyramid and Radar chart,  are disabled when the number of data columns are less than or greater than a  certain number. The ultimate aim is for  the tool to suggest which visualization options are most appropriate for the  underlying dataset.
  </p><br />
                                    <p class="diorg_p"><strong>Sometimes avisualization  button seems to work, but nothing appears when I click on it.</strong><br />
                                      If you are able to click on a visualization tool but can  only see a blank visual, try clicking on Pivot and/or Swap to re-arrange the  data.
  </p><br />
                                    <p class="diorg_p"><strong> If I have multiple  time periods for an indicator, how do I see data that is not the Most Recent  for maps? There is no option to do so in the left pane.</strong><br />
                                      Under the Settings tab, lick on Theme, and then select Time  Period.
  </p><br />
                                    <p class="diorg_p"><strong> I've tried to  change my indicator/area selection in the visualization page, but my previous  selections still appear.</strong><br />
                                      This is normal. Make sure to clear your earlier selection(s)  when you click on &quot;More&quot; in Area and Indicator.
  </p><br />
                                    <p class="diorg_p"><strong> Why can't I  download my treemap charts?</strong><br />
                                      The treemap chart is the only visualization output that  cannot be downloaded, or that cannot have labels (due to technical limitations).  It is an interactive visualization. You can still share the visualization by  clicking on Share, getting the visualization URL or emailing it to yourself,  and sharing it via Facebook/Twitter. You can also save it to the Gallery.</p><br />
